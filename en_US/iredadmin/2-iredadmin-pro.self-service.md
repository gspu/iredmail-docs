# iRedAdmin-Pro: Enable self-service to allow users to manage their own preferences and more

[TOC]

## Introduction

With self-service, end users are able to manage:

* Full name
* Preferred language of iRedAdmin-Pro web interface
* Change password
* Mail forwarding control
* Manager per-user whitelists & blacklists
* Manage quarantined mails
* Check received mails and blacklist certain senders if they're spammers.
* Manage basic spam policy

## How to enable self-service

Self-service is a per-domain setting and disabled by default, domain admin can
enable it in domain profile page, under tab `Advanced`, and it's able to
control which preferences are allowed to be managed by end users themselves.
